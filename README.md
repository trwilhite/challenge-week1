# Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to take the existing code for the Horiseon homepage and edit it to meet accessibility standards and optimize it for search engines.

## Description
The starter code for the homepage did not include semantic HTML elements. There were also no alt attributes for the pictures, and header attributes were not in sequential order. I removed many of the div elements and replaced them with sections and articles to better meet accessibility standards. Also, I added alt attributes for each photo, and fixed the header sequencing. There were some unnecessary classes, so I made more generic classes in the html which helped to clean up and consolidate commands in the CSS file. Lastly, I added comments in CSS to increase organization.
